In this project I have compared two models for the task of Natural Language Inference on the SNLI dataset.

The first model is a logistic regression model with TF-IDF features and the second model is an LSTM model with Glove vectors as word emeddings. The description of both the models is given in the deep_learing_project_report.pdf

To run the code, write python main.py in the terminal.
