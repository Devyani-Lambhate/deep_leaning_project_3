In this project I have compared two models for the task of natural language inference on the SNLI dataset.

The first model is a logistic regression model with TF-IDF features and the seccond model is an LSTM model with Glove vectors as word emeddings. The description of the two models is given in the deep_learing_project_report.pdf

To run the code, write python main.py
